Rails is a web development framework written in the Ruby programming language. It makes web application development more fun.

Rails Design Principles:
- MVC (Model, View, Controller)

  MVC pattern splits an application into three modules a Model, View and Controller. There is "separation of the concerns" among Models, Views and Controllers as each parts has it's own responsibility.

- DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
  
  In this principle developer have to reduce repetition of codes so that code should be more maintainable, more extensible, less buggy.

- Convention over Configuration
  
  This principle allows developer to use default logics and rules used by the framework so that application can be developed in very less time using very few lines of code. For example: if model `Customer` is generated then corressponding database table generated would be `Customers` unless developer configure another name.
