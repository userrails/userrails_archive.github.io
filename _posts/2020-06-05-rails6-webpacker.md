* Webpacker is the JavaScript compiler which compiles the JavaScript code.
* Prior to Rails6, JS code were inside app/assets/javascripts
* In Rails6, no app/assets/javascripts and have new dir `app/javascript` to load all the js files which has `channels` & `packs` and all Javascript components like Turbolinks, ActiveStorage, Rails-UJS, ActionCable support Webpacker.
* Other dir `channels` generated by Rails ActionCable component
* Another dir `packs` which has app/packs/javascripts

```
app/javascript/packs/application.js

require("@rails/ujs").start()
require("turbolinks").start()
require("@rails/activestorage").start()
require("channels")
```

* any js files inside packs/ will autocompiled by Webpack

#### About Pack

* Webpack uses `webpacker gem` which wraps webpack and used to compile the javascript code which are on the packs directory. This gem creates the application pack as application.js inside app/javascript/packs which is similar to assets pipeline (app/assets/javascripts/application.js) and `application` pack is the entry point for all the JavaScript code that contains Action Cable, Active Storage, Turbolinks Rails components.
* `gem webpacker` is automatically placed inside the Gemfile of Rails6 application, and `yarn` is used to install npm packages when creating new Rails 6 application. 

Gem also generates settings:

config/webpacker.yml

* As like assets pipeline, JavaScript code using Webpacker and webpack automatically compiles in development mode when running rails server.
* Gem also generates the file `bin/webpack-dev-server` which is used to live reloading the development phase. Inorder to see the live reloading in development mode we need to run the webpack-dev-server with command `./bin/webpack-dev-server` separately.
* However, in production mode, `rake assets:precompile` also override the `rake webpacker:compile` which will compile the assets pipleline and compile the files to be compiled by webpack which updates the package.json.

# Way to use the JavaScript code in the app

we can use the helper method `javascript_pack_tag` to include the webpacker packs file which is similar to asset pipeline `javascript_link_tag` and works on both development and production mode.

```
# app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
```

* Prior to Rails 6 application do not install `gem webpacker` by default, include it in Gemfile, and run the command `rake webpacker:install`
