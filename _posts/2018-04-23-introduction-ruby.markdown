Ruby is a dynamic, open source, server-side scripting, interpreted, reflective, object-oriented, general purpose programming language. It was designed by Yukihiro Matsumato in Japan in the mid-1990s. Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. Ruby has an automatic memory management and dynamic type system. It can run on multiple platforms such as the various versions of Windows, MAC OS and UNIX.

##### Compile Ruby program
Create a file hello_world.rb and write below code in it
```
  #! /usr/bin/ruby
  puts "Hello World !!";
```
To run above code first go to the directory where hello_world.rb exists, then run the command
```
ruby hello_world.rb
# output is
Hello World !!
```

##### In irb interactive command line mode you can run and test following code:
```
>> puts "Hello, world !!"
Hello, world !!
=> nil
```
