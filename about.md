My name is Shiv Raj Badu and I am a web developer, tech enthusiast, designer and more.

I had practically started learning programming from C programming, C++, and after that, I had learned MS Visual Basic 6 in depth and developed few awesome desktop applications for pharmacy, pathology & labs, schools. 
After spending an year on desktop programming I was interested on web development and I selected the Microsoft ASP.NET open source server side web application framework with C#, in that period I had worked on development of e-inventory management system. During that phase I had also learnt HTML5, CSS3 and PHP.

I started learning new frameworks Sinatra and Rails and I continued it for agile web development, still I am updating myself with Rails and Ruby new release and new updates.

I am experienced on ReactJS, Redux, React Native, VueJS and other JS frameworks.

I have extensive knowledge on CMS development using Wordpress, Drupal and I am supporting my clients on their request.

Loves to expertise over opensource platforms, especially geek of the web development and mobile application development.
